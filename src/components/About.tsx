I hold both a bachelor's and a master's degree in Software Engineering from Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico, one of the top technical universities in Portugal. My interest in technology has been growing over time, and now I am fascinated with the power of programming, knowing that creativity is the limit. In a couple of years, I hope to pursue a career in business, leveraging the knowledge I have gained in technology. I believe that my skills can help create something that can have a positive impact on the world. I started developing Frontend three years ago using React Native, and nowadays I am using ReactJS and NextJS.`}</p>
